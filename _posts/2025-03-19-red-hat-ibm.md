Hello,

Red Hat announced a change in its middleware strategy last month and I wanted to give the RESTEasy community information on how that affects RESTEasy.

The Red Hat announcement can be found on the Red Hat blog:

[Evolving our middleware strategy](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/evolving-our-middleware-strategy){:target="_blank"}


Some key points there are:

* Red Hat’s Middleware and Integration Engineering and Products teams are moving to IBM in May 2025.
* All transitioning Red Hat technology will remain open source and continue to follow an upstream-first development model.

Red Hat has sponsored the RESTEasy project since its inception in 2008, when the first JAX-RS specification was created. Now, Red Hat’s participation in and support for RESTEasy is being transferred to IBM.

While RESTEasy is used in WildFly and JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, it’s also used as a Jakarta REST implementation for standalone applications. RESTEasy is an open source project and will remain an open source project.

There was an announcement about [moving RESTEasy to a foundation](https://resteasy.dev/2025/02/19/resteasy-to-foundation/). Please note the move to a foundation was not triggered by this announcement. This was being thought about for a while, well before the announcement of Red Hat’s strategy.

I’d like to say I’m personally a little sad to leave Red Hat. It has been a fantastic 14 years. However, I’m excited to see what we can all achieve together next.

As always, feel free to reach out to us if you have further questions.
