Today we'd like to announce the release of RESTEasy [6.2.11.Final]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads#6211final) and RESTEasy
[7.0.0.Alpha4]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads#700alpha4).

Both the 7.0.0.Alpha4 and 6.2.11.Final releases have two bug fixes, some component upgrades and two new enhancements.

## 7.0.0.Alpha4

RESTEasy 7.0.0.Alpha4 is a [Jakarta REST 4.0](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/4.0/) implementation. We opted for one more Alpha release before a Beta
to ensure we have all the changes and features we want into this release.

### Bugs:

* [RESTEASY-3502](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3502) - The Jackson Provider should add the Jackson Jdk8Module and JavaTimeModule by default
* [RESTEASY-3554](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3554) - The RESTEasy Vert.x client may produce a null pointer

### Enhancements:

* [RESTEASY-3539](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3539) - Add better options for registering `ClientHttpEngine`'s
* [RESTEASY-3542](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3542) - Allow the multipart provider to define where it writes buffered data

Full releases notes can be found at [https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/releases/tag/7.0.0.Alpha4](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/releases/tag/7.0.0.Alpha4).


## 6.2.11.Final

RESTEasy 6.2.11.Final is a [Jakarta REST 3.1](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/3.1/) implementation.

### Bugs:

* [RESTEASY-3502](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3502) - The Jackson Provider should add the Jackson Jdk8Module and JavaTimeModule by default
* [RESTEASY-3554](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3554) - The RESTEasy Vert.x client may produce a null pointer

### Enhancements:

* [RESTEASY-3539](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3539) - Add better options for registering `ClientHttpEngine`'s
* [RESTEASY-3542](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3542) - Allow the multipart provider to define where it writes buffered data

The [RESTEASY-3539](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3539) enhancement that in most cases we would not included 
in a patch release. However, this will allow for better integration with external clients. We will potentially add some
more options for clients in the future. Do note though that if you implement the new interface, it will not be
compatible with older versions of RESTEasy.

Full releases notes can be found at [https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/releases/tag/6.2.11.Final](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/releases/tag/6.2.11.Final).

## New `ClientHttpEngineFactory` API

In [RESTEASY-3539](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3539) we introduce a new 
`org.jboss.resteasy.client.jaxrs.engine.ClientHttpEngineFactory` interface and a 
`org.jboss.resteasy.client.jaxrs.api.ClientBuilderConfiguration` interface. These can be used to create new `ClientHttpEngine`'s
with a backing HTTP client if your choice. You simply need to implement the 
`org.jboss.resteasy.client.jaxrs.engine.ClientHttpEngineFactory` interface and include it as a service in your 
library or deployment and ensure it's on the class path.

With this new interface, to use the RESTEasy Jetty Client or RESTEasy Vert.x Client you now simply need to place those
libraries on the class path. You no longer need to register the `ClientHttpEngine` on your client builder.

Also note that the RESTEasy Jetty Client in the `org.jboss.resteasy:resteasy-jetty-client` dependency has been deprecated. 
However, the project was moved to an [independent project](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy-jetty/). The migration is 
simple, use the new `dev.resteasy.jetty:resteasy-jetty-client` dependency and change the package names from 
`org.jboss.resteasy.client.jaxrs.engines.jetty` to `dev.resteasy.jetty.client.engine`. If you are not required to create
a custom RESTEasy Jetty Client, then you can simply add it to your class path once 
[implemented](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy-jetty/issues/12), after a component upgrade.

## New `dev.resteasy.entity.tmpdir` Configuration Option

This is a simple option that allows you control where temporary entity files are created. These files are created for
entities which exceed the maximum memory threshold. Please note the directory must exist prior to using this setting.

## Finally

As always, [feedback](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/discussions/) is welcome. Stay safe, and, depending on where you are, stay warm or be cool.
