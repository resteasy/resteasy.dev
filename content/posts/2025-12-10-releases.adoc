Today we are excited to announce the release of RESTEasy link:/downloads#6215final[6.2.15.Final] and RESTEasy
link:/downloads#700final[7.0.1.Final]. Both releases consist mostly of bug fixes and component upgrades.

== Breaking Changes

One breaking change, that will only affect users of the WildFly Channel, has also been made. The change was simply to change
the Maven group id from `dev.resteasy.channels` to `org.jboss.resteasy.channels`. This was done as changes were needed
for releasing to Maven Central. This was changed in both 7.0.1.Final and 6.2.15.Final.

== 7.0.1.Final

RESTEasy 7.0.1.Final is a https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/4.0/[Jakarta REST 4.0] implementation. This
release contains mostly bug fixes and component upgrades.
