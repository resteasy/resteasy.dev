Today we are excited to announce the release of RESTEasy link:/downloads#6214final[6.2.14.Final] and RESTEasy
link:/downloads#700final[7.0.0.Final]. RESTEasy 7.0.0.Final has been a long time coming and likely could have been
final a while ago. However, we had some housekeeping we wanted to get done first.

The release of 7.0.0.Final is a major milestone. It finalizes our effort to streamline the core framework and move
key integrations into their own separate projects. This allows them to be versioned and released independently, giving
users more flexibility.

== Major Changes

With RESTEasy 7.0, the Vert.x, Netty, and Jetty integrations have been moved from the core repository into their own
projects. The old artifacts are now deprecated in 6.2.14.Final and have been removed completely in 7.0.0.Final.

We strongly recommend all users migrate to the new group and artifact IDs (GAVs), as all future development and fixes
will happen in these new repositories.

The following table maps the old GAVs to the new ones:

|===
|Old/Removed GA |New GAV

|`org.jboss.resteasy:resteasy-netty4`
|`dev.resteasy.netty:resteasy-embedded-server:1.0.0.Final`

|`org.jboss.resteasy:resteasy-netty4-cdi`
|`dev.resteasy.netty:resteasy-embedded-server-cdi:1.0.0.Final`

|`org.jboss.resteasy:resteasy-reactor-netty`
|`dev.resteasy.netty:resteasy-embedded-server-reactor:1.0.0.Final`

|`org.jboss.resteasy:resteasy-client-reactor-netty`
|`dev.resteasy.netty:resteasy-reactor-netty-client:1.0.0.Final`

|`org.jboss.resteasy:resteasy-netty4`
|`dev.resteasy.netty:resteasy-embedded-server:1.0.0.Final`

|`org.jboss.resteasy:resteasy-vertx`
|`dev.resteasy.vertx:resteasy-vertx-embedded-server:1.0.1.Final`

|`org.jboss.resteasy:resteasy-client-vertx`
|`dev.resteasy.vertx:resteasy-vertx-client:1.0.1.Final`

|`org.jboss.resteasy:resteasy-client-jetty`
|`dev.resteasy.jetty:resteasy-jetty-client:1.0.0.Alpha2`

[WARNING]
====
The package for the Netty Reactor Client changed. This had to be done as it used the same package as the RESTEasy Client
and causes a package split between the two artifacts.
