As with other projects, like [WildFly](https://www.wildfly.org/news/2025/02/03/WildFly-in-a-Foundation/), RESTEasy has 
been looking at moving to a vendor-neutral software foundation. Our hope is that by doing this we can further expand our 
community, improve our openness and transparency, refresh our governance model, and encourage more participation by 
contributors not affiliated with Red Hat.

As of recently we've moved some projects out of the default RESTEasy repository into their own repository. This gives us 
the ability to release these projects at different intervals or as needed. Having RESTEasy in a foundation will allow the 
community to have more participation in these projects.

## Important Considerations

Moving to a foundation is not a trivial task, so it's critical that the choice we make is a net benefit to our community. 
To help ensure this, there are a number of key factors we're looking at when evaluating what foundation would be the best fit:

* Flexibility to continue to use the current tooling we have around the project. For example, continue usage of our issue tracker.
* Maintain as much as possible our current release processes.
* Retain independence in decision-making, particularly on technical matters and not have foundation imposed rules.

## Support and Alignment with Red Hat Values

Red Hat is dedicated to participating in and supporting vendor-neutral collaboration projects, such as the Linux kernel, 
Kubernetes, and OpenJDK; doing so is part of the company's DNA. Red Hat business leaders are fully supportive of this move.

## Community Feedback

We'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Let us know what you're thinking on ~~the [mailing list](https://lists.jboss.org/archives/list/resteasy-dev@lists.jboss.org/) or~~ the [discussion topic](https://github.com/orgs/resteasy/discussions/4513).
